# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

##  Using Javascript to Make Your Page Interactive

    Javascript is a commonly used text-based programming languaged used to make your HTML page interactive. While HTML and CSS give you the structure and style, Javascript will help to enaage the User to do different things such as generating a password. The purpose of this project is to create a webpage using Javascript to help the User to generate a password that may consist of letters(lowercase or uppercase), numbers, and special characters.

## Usage 

1) Open the Index.html file with Chrome/Firefox web browsers:
1) Click on the "Generate Password" red button. 
2) A prompt will popup and ask how long you want your password to be. See [First question Demo](How-To-Use.PNG). It is important to remember that the password length has to be between 8-128 exclusively. If User puts anything not in between, an alert message will pop up on the screen. User will have to try again.
3) Select Ok (Yes) or Cancel (No) for each questions being asked after User answers the first question properly.
4) A password will be generated based on your choices in the box. See [Click Button Demo](How-To-Use-I.PNG).

As you proceed in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s homework invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.
