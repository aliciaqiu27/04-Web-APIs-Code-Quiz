# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

##  Using Javascript to Create a Code Quiz with a Timer

    Javascript is a commonly used text-based programming language used to make your HTML page interactive. While HTML and CSS give you the structure and style, Javascript will help to engage the User to do different things such as making a quiz. The purpose of this project is to create a webpage using Javascript to provide the User to take a quiz within the alloted time.

## Usage 

1) Open the Index.html file with Chrome/Firefox web browsers:
1) Click on the "Start Quiz" button to go to the first question question. See [Start Quiz Demo](How-To-Use-I.PNG).The timer will then start counting down from 4 minutes. 
2) A multiple choice question will appear with four answer choices. Click one of the blue buttons containing your answer and then click on the "Next" green button. 
3) A prompt will appear notifying the User if the question was answered correctly.
4) After answering all the questions, the total score will appear on the screen.

As you proceed in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s homework invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.
